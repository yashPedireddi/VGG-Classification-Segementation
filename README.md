# Image Classification and Segmentation on Visual Geometry Group Dataset

Two deep learning architectures for classifying and segmenting the flower dataset in the Visual Geometry Group database are proposed. Custom model architectures have been developed rather than relying on large pre-trained models. The architecture design is inspired by the ideas from the Resnet, Unet, and Fully Convolutional Networks(FCN) architecture. For the classification task, we have used a convolutional skip connection to propagate the output from the previous layer, an idea inspired by the Residual net architecture. For the segmentation task, instead of plain down sampling and up sampling network, we have concatenated the output of downsampling to the output of upsampling to preserve the spatial information.
